# Identicon

An Identicon is a visual representation of a hash value, usually of an IP address, that serves to identify a user of a computer system as a form of avatar while protecting the user's privacy. The original Identicon was a 9-block graphic, and the representation has been extended to other graphic forms by third parties.

Here I did code a module to create a PNG file Identicon based on string input.

## Usage

```bash
iex -S mix
iex> Identicon.main "Farhad"
```
